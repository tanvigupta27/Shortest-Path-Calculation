# Shortest-Path-Calculation

It calculates shortest path between two nodes using Floyd Warshall Algorithm and Dijkistra's Algorithm.
User can create a graph of his/her own choice and then use either of the two algorithms to calculate shortest path.
The whole projcect contains 5 modules-
1. Node Creation- Specify number of nodes for graph in this function.
2. Node Movement- Drag and drop the nodes to create a graph.
3. Connection Establishment- Add weight to the nodes to establish a connection between them.
4. Find Path- Calculate shortest path between the specified nodes.
5. Highlight Path- Highlight(in graph) and return the shortest path.
